# End-to-End-Restaurant-Data-Pipeline-From-EDA-to-Insight-Generation-in-Python

# Overview
This project was developed during my Data Analytics Internship at Codec Technologies, certified by AICTE & ICAC and supported by Google for Education. The goal was to perform a comprehensive Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on a multi-city restaurant dataset to uncover insights into customer behavior, pricing trends, service availability, and rating dynamics.

# Objectives
Clean and preprocess raw restaurant data for analysis. 
Explore categorical and numerical features to identify patterns. 
Visualize trends across cities, cuisines, price ranges, and service types. 
Deliver actionable insights for business intelligence and strategic decision-making. 

# Tools & Technologies
Programming Language: Python. 
Libraries: pandas, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn. 
Platform: Google Colab. 
Data Format: CSV. 
Documentation: Mind maps, visual dashboards. 

# Project Workflow
1. Project Setup
Imported essential libraries (pandas, numpy, matplotlib.pyplot, seaborn, warnings) . 
Configured paths and loaded dataset using pd.read_csv().
Enabled inline plotting and set visualization styles with sns.set().

2. Dataset Handling
Previewed data using .head(), .info(), .describe(include='all'), and .isnull().sum().
Cleaned data by dropping duplicates and handling missing values (fillna, median imputation).
Renamed, reordered, and dropped columns for clarity and relevance.
Saved cleaned dataset for reproducibility.

3. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
Univariate & Categorical Analysis.
Value counts, unique values, top categories.
Distribution of rating colors, price ranges, and service types.
Frequency analysis of cuisines and restaurant types.

# Visual Insights
Top cities by restaurant count.
Rating vs Votes correlation.
Price range distribution across cities.
Online delivery and table booking trends.
Most common cuisines overall and city-wise.
Rating vs Price Range comparison.
Top restaurants by rating, votes, and cost-for-two.

# Advanced Visuals
Correlation heatmaps.
Rating text distribution.
Service availability vs customer satisfaction.
Geo-driven insights (city-level segmentation).

# Key Deliverables
Cleaned and structured dataset.
Insight-rich visualizations.
Mind maps outlining the full analytical workflow.
Internship completion certificate and offer letter (AICTE & ICAC certified).

# Outcome
This project strengthened my ability to translate raw data into meaningful insights, combining technical rigor with business relevance. It also enhanced my skills in data storytelling, visualization, and professional documentationâ€”essential for real-world analytics roles.

# Project Summary
This project was developed as part of my Data Analytics Internship at Codec Technologies, conducted from July 10 to September 10, 2025. The objective was to perform a comprehensive Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on a multi-city restaurant dataset to uncover insights into customer preferences, pricing behavior, service availability, and rating dynamics. The project was executed using Python and visualized through structured mind maps and dashboards, combining technical rigor with business intelligence.
